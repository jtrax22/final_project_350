My first data set i will be looking into is on cause of mortality among
college students. The data set has different ethnicities, gender, and age. 
What made me interested in this topic is the recent death of a 
college student on U of A campus. I wanted to explore the data and see if 
I could correlate anything in order to gain knowledge on the topic. Here is

I have been seeing a lot of skeptic on climate change on social media
and talking to a different range of people. I believe in climate change 
but wanted to actually look at data myself. I wanted to look at CO2 levels 
specifically. This data set explores data going back to the 1700s which I
liked. It has different levels of Gas, Liquid, Solid fuel. It also includes
cement and gas flaring per capita. I would be excited to find out some things
about CO2 levels on my own with this data. https://datahub.io/core/co2-fossil-global
